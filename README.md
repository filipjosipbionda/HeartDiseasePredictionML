# RUAP - Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the **"Service Computing and Data Analysis"** course. It is an Android application that utilizes **Azure Machine Learning** to predict the risk of heart disease based on user-provided medical data.

The system processes input parameters such as **age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key health indicators**, and returns a probability percentage of heart disease occurrence. Based on this probability, users receive a **risk assessment and personalized recommendations**.
